# DEFCON32-Raygun

## **A word of caution from our armchair lawyer:**

### **Electronics Beware:**  
Keep this away from medical gear, radios, airplanes, power grids, slot machines, and anything else you don't want to glitch. No, seriously – you can potentially damage things with this badge.

### **Shock Hazard:**  
Don't be dumb like us, we tested it for you – it hurts. While we have tried to shield you from the high voltage circuitry, be sure to avoid contact with the tip or any components between the two PCBs so you don't get shocked. People with pacemakers should not touch this badge at all.

### **Legalities:**  
You're on the hook for knowing and following all the laws. We're not responsible for any trouble you cause, and ESV absolutely will throw you under the bus by saying "we warned you very clearly not to abuse this badge."

### **No Kids:**  
We shouldn't have to write this, but seriously – this isn't a toy and shouldn't be given to kids. See the shock hazard, they could get hurt.

### **This is an experimental device:**  
This badge is sold as-is. No warranty, no guarantees, no promises.
